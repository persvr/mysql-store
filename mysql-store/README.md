The mongodb-store is an NodeJS implementation of the object store interface for MongoDB storage,
providing access to MongoDB databases for [Persevere](http://persvr.org), any other consumer that uses
the object store interface (Dojo also uses this interface), and for direct interaction. This
store supports RQL for convenient web-based querying that matches well with MongoDB
querying capabilities.

Setup
=====

mongodb-store can be installed with NPM via:

	npm install mongodb-store

If you are using this with Persevere, please see the Persevere [documentation](http://persvr.org/Documentation).

Licensing
--------

mongodb-store is part of the Persevere project, and therefore is licensed under the
AFL or BSD license. The Persevere project is administered under the Dojo foundation,
and all contributions require a Dojo CLA.
